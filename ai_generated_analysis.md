HAI Security Dataset Analysis: Building a Time-Series Analysis Model
Based on the HAI (HIL-based Augmented ICS) Security Dataset documentation, I can provide recommendations for building a time-series analysis model focused on anomaly detection in industrial control systems. This dataset is particularly valuable as it contains both normal operations and various attack scenarios in a realistic industrial control system environment.
Dataset Understanding
The HAI dataset contains:

Multiple versions (20.07, 21.03, 22.04, and 23.05) with increasing complexity and coverage
Normal operational data collected continuously over several days
Abnormal data with various attack scenarios targeting different control loops
Data points for pressure, temperature, flow rate, water level controls and other parameters
Detailed information on control logic and attack propagation

Recommended Model Approach
1. Data Preprocessing

Time alignment: Ensure all data points are properly time-aligned for correlation analysis
Feature engineering: Create derived features capturing relationships between variables
Normalization: Standardize values to account for different scales across sensors
Missing value handling: Implement strategies for handling any gaps in the time series
Segmentation: Divide data into operational states to enable contextual analysis

2. Model Architecture
I recommend a multi-level approach:
Level 1: Process-Specific Models

Build separate models for each control process (P1-PC, P1-LC, P1-FC, P1-TC, P2-SC, P3-LC)
Use LSTM or GRU networks to capture temporal dependencies in each process
Incorporate attention mechanisms to identify relevant historical patterns

Level 2: Cross-Process Correlation

Implement a graph neural network using the provided NetworkX data
Model the dependencies between processes as documented in the attack propagation chains
Use the physics-related flow graph to inform physical constraints in the model

Level 3: Anomaly Detection

Train an autoencoder to learn normal operation patterns
Use reconstruction error as an anomaly score
Implement a time series forecasting model to detect deviations from predicted values
Add classification layers to categorize detected anomalies by attack type

3. Training Strategy

Train on normal data: Build the baseline model on the normal operation datasets
Fine-tune with attack data: Use a portion of attack scenarios for supervised learning
Validation: Test against remaining attack scenarios to evaluate detection performance
Cross-version validation: Test models trained on earlier versions against newer datasets

4. Evaluation Metrics

Use the recommended eTaPR metric mentioned in the documentation for proper evaluation of time-series anomaly detection
Measure both point-wise accuracy and sequence-level detection capability
Track attack detection latency (time to detection after attack initiation)
Evaluate false positive rates during normal operations

5. Explainability Components

Implement root-cause analysis using the backward graph traversal technique described in the document
Visualize attack propagation chains when anomalies are detected
Report affected control loops and potentially compromised components

Implementation Considerations

Data volume management: The dataset contains hundreds of hours of high-frequency time series data across multiple data points
Multi-scale analysis: Develop capability to detect both short-term and long-term attack patterns (the dataset includes both ST and LT attacks)
Real-time processing: Design the model for potential real-time implementation with appropriate latency constraints
Model updating: Create a mechanism to periodically retrain the model as new normal operational patterns emerge
Resource efficiency: Optimize for deployment in industrial settings where computational resources may be limited

This approach leverages the rich structure of the HAI dataset while addressing the challenges of time-series anomaly detection in industrial control systems.
